            <p> We can make beautiful web pages by adding texts,images and audios.
                Inorder to understand
                how we can make
                attractive webpages we need to understand about web development first.
                <br>

                Web development refers to the tasks associated with creating building and maintaining websites and web
                applications that run online on a broswer.
                <br>

                Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web
                design). The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is
                to say, the programming of sites).

                <br>


                The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup
                Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs
                used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from
                scratch” by writing code.
